A blacksmithing game created for the 2021 College Game Jam <br />


Instructions: <br />

Use num 1, 2, or 3 to select a pattern, then use keyboard 1 or 2 to add an ingot to the anvil. <br />

Click and hold to charge a strike, click again shortly after release with at least 25% charge to strike. Performing a strike over the anvil's hole will delete all voxels affected by the strike. <br />

Use WASD to move the metal around the anvil, use Q and E to rotate. <br />
<25% = no effect <br />
< 50% = creates a single voxel in front of target <br />
< 75% = creates a cross shape centered on target <br />
<= 100% = creates a square centered on target <br />

Press space to move to the forge, click and drag to heat up metal <br />
Metal must be at least red-hot to forge, but will be destroyed if it becomes too hot. <br />
